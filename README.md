Health Monitoring System using IOT
This project aims to enhance remote patient monitoring, promote early detection of cardiac anomalies, and improve overall healthcare management. The integration of ESP32 and AD8232 presents a promising solution for continuous and non-invasive ECG monitoring, which can be invaluable in preventing and managing cardiac-related disorders.
